## Single trait distribution  
I will be exploring morphological variation in flipper length between the three penguin species.  

```{r flipper length}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color=species)) +
  theme_bw()


penguins%>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, color = species, fill = species), alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()
```


This demonstrates that Gentoo penguins have consistently longer flippers than either Adelie or Chinstrap penguins and there is little overlap. Chinstrap penguins on average have longer flippers than Adelie penguins, but these two species have a lot of overlap in their spread.
